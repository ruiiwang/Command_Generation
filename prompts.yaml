  Generate at least {count} possible ways users might express this instruction in the given language.
  Avoid duplicates and keep them concise. Do not add quotation marks before and after.

  You are given a user variation and the original instruction.
  Rate how similar in intent the variation is to the instruction on a scale from 0 to 5,
  with 0 meaning completely different and 5 meaning exactly the same.

  Generate {count} user expressions that could be easily confused with this target intent. Focus on the most common and natural user expressions where users might use similar expressions but actually mean different intents.
  Rules:
  - Keep it SHORT (3-10 words)
  - Must sound natural
  - Change the intent slightly
  - Use the same key words
  Requirements:
  - Keep it SHORT and SIMPLE
  - Must be natural daily expressions
  - Focus on high-frequency user expressions
  - Use similar core words but different meanings
  For example, if the target intent is "Take a picture" (photo capturing):
  Good examples (different intents but easily confused):
  - "How do I take better pictures?"  (help/guidance)
  - "Check camera settings"          (settings)
  - "Is my camera working?"          (status check)
  - "Prepare camera for photo"       (preparation)
  - "Show my recent pictures"        (management)
  Avoid:
  - Complex or long expressions
  - Technical language
  - Rare or unusual requests
  - Obviously different commands

  You are given a user variation and the original instruction.
  Rate how likely this instruction could be confused with the target instruction on a scale from 0 to 5,
  with 0 meaning completely unconfusing and 5 meaning very confusing.
  Scoring guide:
  5 - Extremely confusing: Uses nearly identical keywords, very similar context
  4 - Very confusing: Highly related action, same domain
  3 - Moderately confusing: Related action, similar keywords
  2 - Somewhat confusing: Same domain but different purpose
  1 - Slightly confusing: Shares some keywords but clearly different
  0 - Not confusing: Completely different intent
  Consider:
  1. Keyword similarity: How many key terms are shared?
  2. Context overlap: How similar is the usage scenario?
  3. User behavior: Is this a common user confusion pattern?
  4. Functional proximity: How close is the requested action to the target?
  5. Natural language patterns: How similar is the expression structure?
