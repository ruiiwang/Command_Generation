  Instruction: {instruction}
  Language: {language}
  context: {context}
  Generate {count} expressions that users might confuse with this target intent.
  Think about these common scenarios:
   - Before the action (preparation/settings)
   - After the action (checking results)
   - Related status queries
   - Help or information seeking
   - Similar but different actions
  Common confusion patterns to consider:
   - Question vs Command ("take a picture" -> "how to take pictures")
   - Check vs Execute ("take a picture" -> "check camera")
   - Past vs Present ("take a picture" -> "show my pictures")
   - Settings vs Action ("take a picture" -> "camera settings")
   - Help vs Execute ("take a picture" -> "picture help")
  Requirements:
   - Must be short (2-6 words)
   - Must be casual daily expressions
   - Focus on:
      Questions about the action
      Checking status/results
      Settings related
      Help seeking
      Similar function queries
  For example, if the target intent is "Take a picture" (photo capturing):
  Good examples (different intents but easily confused):
  - "How do I take better pictures?"
  - "Check camera settings"
  - "Is my camera working?"
  - "Prepare camera for photo"
  - "Show my recent pictures"
  Avoid:
  - Complex or long expressions
  - Technical language
  - Rare or unusual requests
  - Obviously different commands

  Please consider:
  1. Linguistic similarity
  2. Usage scenario overlap
  3. Common user behavior patterns
  4. Keyword/command pattern similarity
