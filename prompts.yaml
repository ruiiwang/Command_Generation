  Generate {count} user expressions that could be easily confused with this target intent. Focus on the most common and natural user expressions where users might use similar expressions but actually mean different intents.
  Rules:
  - Keep it SHORT (3-10 words)
  - Must sound natural
  - Change the intent slightly
  - Use the same key words
  Requirements:
  - Keep it SHORT and SIMPLE
  - Must be natural daily expressions
  - Focus on high-frequency user expressions
  - Use similar core words but different meanings
  For example, if the target intent is "Take a picture" (photo capturing):
  Good examples (different intents but easily confused):
  - "How do I take better pictures?"
  - "Check camera settings"
  - "Is my camera working?"
  - "Prepare camera for photo"
  - "Show my recent pictures"
  Avoid:
  - Complex or long expressions
  - Technical language
  - Rare or unusual requests
  - Obviously different commands
